# Zoo-Management-System
The Zoo Management System is a simple, file-based C++ console application designed to manage animals and zookeepers in a zoo. It offers an interactive menu-driven interface with features for adding, updating, searching, and displaying records. It uses basic file handling (fstream) to store data persistently in .txt files.
